Tytos Lannister is breathing his last few days, and so wants to distribute all his money within his huge family. His huge family forms a tree, with the members as its vertices. Each member is given a unique integer as his ID.
His old age has rendered him insane and he devises a new plan to distribute his gold coins. He gives you (his right hand) a parchment with
U u v string
U -> Distributing the Gold Coins
u , v -> id’s of two member of the Family.
string -> a 15 character string. Includes characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’.
‘a’ -> 1 gold coin
‘b’ -> 2 gold coins
.
.
‘z’ -> 26 gold coins
Decode each alphabet of the string into a seq of 15 numbers. Lets call them seq[0], seq[1].... seq[14] determined by the value of each character.
According to the parchment you are to distribute seq[i%15] gold coins to the ith member along the unique path from ‘u’ to ‘v’. You start distributing from ‘u’ uptil ‘v‘ and ‘u’ is the 0th vertex.

Next he has a parchment with
Q u v
Q -> Counting the total number of gold coins on the unique path connecting ‘u’ and ‘v’ ( u and v inclusive).
Input:

The first line contains N the number of members in his family tree. N-1 lines follow which are the edges of of his family tree.
The N+1th line contains K the number of queries. K lines follow each of one of the format:
U u v string
Q u v
where u and v are integers u, v < N and string is 15 character long with each character between ‘a’ to ‘z’
Output:

For each query of the form
Q u v
output a line denoting a single line denoting the no of gold coins on the corresponding path. As the result can be long, print the answer modulo 1007.
Sample Input:

5
0 1
0 2
0 3
3 4
5
U 0 2 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Q 0 3
U 1 4 abcdefghijklmno
U 0 0 abbbbbbbbbbbbbb
Q 1 4
Sample Output

1
12
Constraint:

Sum of N across all test cases in a single test file <= 100000
Sum of K across all test cases in a single test file <= 25000
